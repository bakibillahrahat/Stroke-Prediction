# Stroke-Prediction on Naïve Bayes Classifier machine learning models

## What is a Stroke?

A stroke, sometimes called a brain attack, occurs when something blocks blood supply to part of the brain or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts. In either case, parts of the brain become damaged or die. A stroke can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death.

## Why we need stroke prediction analysis?


This delay is particularly concerning when we consider that Ischemic stroke patients suffer the loss of two million brain cells every minute until blood flow is restored. In this context, an earlier diagnosis can mean faster treatment, with one Harvard Medical study breaking down the benefits as follows:

“For every 15-minute acceleration of time to…treatment, found:

* 4% lower risk of in-hospital death
* 4% better odds of walking independently after leaving the hospital
* 3% better odds of being sent home instead of to an institution
* 4% lower odds of a brain hemorrhage.”
