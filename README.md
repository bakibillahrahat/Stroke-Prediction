# Stroke-Prediction on Naïve Bayes Classifier machine learning models
What is a Stroke?
A stroke, often referred to as a brain attack, occurs when blood supply to part of the brain is blocked or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts. In either case, parts of the brain become damaged or die, leading to potential long-term disability or even death.

Importance of Stroke Prediction Analysis
The urgency in stroke prediction analysis is crucial due to the severe consequences of delayed diagnosis. Ischemic stroke patients suffer the loss of two million brain cells every minute until blood flow is restored. Early diagnosis can significantly impact treatment outcomes, as highlighted by a Harvard Medical study:

For every 15-minute acceleration of time to treatment:
4% lower risk of in-hospital death
4% better odds of walking independently after leaving the hospital
3% better odds of being sent home instead of to an institution
4% lower odds of a brain hemorrhage
Models Used
1. Gaussian Naive Bayes
Naive Bayes methods are supervised learning algorithms based on applying Bayes’ theorem. They assume conditional independence between every pair of features given the value of the class variable.

Results
Gaussian Naive Bayes: 97.57%
